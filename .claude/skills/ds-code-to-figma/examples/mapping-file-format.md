# Mapping file format

`<name>.figma.md` lives at `packages/core/src/components/<category>/<name>/<name>.figma.md`,
co-located with the component's other files. It's both the input spec you confirm in Phases 1–2
and the output record Phase 3 writes back into. A family has one file per member, next to each
member's `.tsx` — see [Family fields](#family-fields) below.

sets: # filled in by Phase 3 — one entry per component set (top-level split), default set first.

# A parent component nesting this one uses the first entry's figmaComponentKey.

- name: Close # default set — bare name; also its stack's sub-label
  figmaComponentKey: null

# component's own name; multiple components share one page (see CONVENTIONS.md's category table)

figmaDocFrameNodeId: null # this component's "<Component> Documentation" frame id within the

# documentation-frames row — filled in by Phase 3, since the page itself

# no longer uniquely identifies a single component's content

anatomy:

- letter: A
  part: label
  description: "The text label wrapper (<span>)."
- letter: B
  part: icon
  description: "The leading icon wrapper (or the brand icon wrapper when brandIcon is set)."

# Omit this whole `anatomy:` key if the component has no @part tags at all.

## Variations field

Drafted in Phase 1 (step 4a), confirmed in Phase 2, node ids written back by Phase 3. In the
owner's file for a family (it covers sub-component sets too). Omit it when no set has a
`show <name>` boolean.

```yaml
variations:
  figmaSectionNodeId: null # the kind=variations Section in the Documentation column
  sets: # default set and rule-1 splits, never …Inverted; build order in a family
    - set: SpinnerLogo
      previewNodeId: null
      entries:
        - caption: 'show label · right' # one per option of each dependent axis
          props: { show label: true, label position: right }
          snapshot: spinner-label-right # visual test case, or missing (Phase 2 adds it)
          nodeId: null
        - caption: 'all on' # every show boolean true, default variant otherwise
          props: { show label: true }
          snapshot: missing
          nodeId: null
```

## Family fields

Only for a family with sub-components (`../conventions/families.md`). A family of one has none of
these.

**Owner** (`tabs/tabs/tabs.figma.md`) — adds to the schema above:

```yaml
nested:
  - childTag: ds-tab
    childMappingFile: ../tab/tab.figma.md
    subComponent: true # built in this run — never a missing-mapping hard stop
    relation: contained # contained (renders inside the owner) | wrapping (renders the owner inside itself)
    figmaComponentKey: null # filled by Phase 3 from tab.figma.md → sets[0]
  - childTag: ds-tab-panel
    childMappingFile: ../tab-panel/tab-panel.figma.md
    subComponent: true
    relation: contained
    figmaComponentKey: null
slots: # one per code @slot that takes sub-component instances — in the file of the component that declares the @slot
  - codeSlot: tab # '' for the default slot
    figmaSlot: tabs # lowercase
    preferred: [Tab] # TabsInverted's slot prefers TabInverted
    defaultFill: '3 × Tab — first selected=true; labels "Tab 1", "Tab 2", "Tab 3"' # confirmed in Phase 2
  - codeSlot: ''
    figmaSlot: tab panels
    preferred: [TabPanel]
    defaultFill: '1 × TabPanel (the selected one)'
anatomy: # merged list for the whole family
  - letter: A
    part: tablist
    description: 'The tablist container.'
  - letter: B
    subComponent: ds-tab # one entry per contained sub-component
    part: Tab (ds-tab)
    description: 'Tab renders a single tab button inside a ds-tabs group.'
  # a sub-component with more than one @part adds B1, B2, … ; a single @part collapses into its entry
measurements:
  rows:
    - property: Padding X
      set: Tab # every row names its set; sub-component rows live here, not in their own file
      # …rest as in the schema above
```

**Sub-component** (`tabs/tab/tab.figma.md`) — the schema above, plus `owner:`, minus `anatomy:` and
`measurements:`:

```yaml
owner: ../tabs/tabs.figma.md # documentation owner; its frame is this file's figmaDocFrameNodeId
sets:
  - name: Tab
    figmaComponentKey: null
    figmaMasterNodeId: null
  - name: TabInverted # inverted mirror of the owner's split
    figmaComponentKey: null
    figmaMasterNodeId: null
figmaPage: Core / Navigation
figmaDocFrameNodeId: null # = the owner's "Tabs Documentation" frame
props:
  - name: inverted
    type: boolean
    drivenBy: ds-tabs.inverted # parent-set prop (@internal, "Set by ds-tabs")
    figmaPropertyType: top-level-split (rule 2, mirrors owner)
  - name: vertical
    type: boolean
    drivenBy: ds-tabs.vertical
    figmaProperty: vertical
    figmaPropertyType: variant
  - name: selected
    type: boolean # public, set per instance by the designer — no drivenBy
    figmaProperty: selected
    figmaPropertyType: variant
  - name: name
    type: string
    figmaPropertyType: excluded # identifier, no visual effect
```
