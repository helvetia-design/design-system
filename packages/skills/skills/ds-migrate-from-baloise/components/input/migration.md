Migrate every `bal-input` usage to `ds-input`, and every `bal-input-date` usage to `ds-datepicker`. Init has already added the `@helvetia-design/*` packages. This task rewrites usages only.

The legacy folder has two consumer child tags. `bal-input-date` is a text field with a date mask and no calendar. The closest new component is `ds-datepicker`, so the two tags map to different components. `ds-input` has no date mask and `type="date"` renders the native browser widget, so do not map `bal-input-date` to `ds-input`. `bal-input-group` is a wrapper that only styles its children. It disappears, and its icons and buttons move into the `start` and `end` slots of `ds-input`.

Other legacy tags that start with `bal-input` are different components and are not part of this migration: `bal-input-slider` (see `components/input-slider/migration.md`), `bal-input-stepper` (see `components/input-stepper/migration.md`). `bal-number-input` is a separate component too. The scan does not list them.

A surrounding `bal-field`, `bal-field-label`, `bal-field-control` and `bal-field-message` wrapper is handled by `shared/field.md` in the Rewrite step, in the same pass. `components/field/migration.md` migrates `bal-form-grid` and `bal-form-col`.

## 1. Scan

`<project-root>` is the consumer project root that contains the app lockfile. When the skill is invoked from that root, use the current directory.

```bash
node <this-skill-directory>/scripts/scan-bal-input.mjs <project-root>
```

The script prints one JSON object. `total` is the number of findings. `files` groups them by path. Each finding has `line` and `snippet`.

Show that list to the user grouped by file (path, line, snippet) and end with the total count.

Done when the user has seen every finding and the total. If `total` is 0, say there are no `bal-input` usages to migrate and stop.

## 2. Confirm

Ask for one yes/no: rewrite every listed usage?

On no, stop with the files unchanged.

On yes, continue. Editing starts only after that answer.

Done when the user has answered.

## 3. Rewrite

Edit each finding yourself, using the mapping below. Read the whole element when attributes continue past the snippet's first line. This step is finished when every finding matches the mapping.

### `bal-input-group` → slots of `ds-input`

Unwrap every `bal-input-group` before you rename the `bal-input` inside it, and before `shared/field.md` unwraps a surrounding `bal-field`.

Remove the `bal-input-group` tags. Every child element before the `bal-input` moves into it with `slot="start"`, and every child element after it moves into it with `slot="end"`. The `bal-input` then becomes a `ds-input` with the props below. In React, a self-closing `<BalInput />` gets a closing tag. An icon is a `bal-icon` or `ds-icon` (`BalIcon`, `DsIcon`), a button is a `bal-button` or `ds-button` (`BalButton`, `DsButton`). Children keep their tag. `bal-icon` and `bal-button` stay, because their own migrations rename them, and `ds-icon` and `ds-button` children are already fine. A kept `bal-icon` or `bal-button` also keeps its `name` and `icon` values, because the legacy component still looks them up; their own migrations apply the name rule of `shared/icons.md`. When a JSX expression (`{show && <BalIcon … />}`), an Angular control-flow block (`@if`) or an `ng-container` with a structural directive wraps exactly one icon or button, put the `slot` on that element. Whitespace and comments between the children stay where they are.

```html
<!-- before -->
<bal-input-group disabled>
  <bal-icon name="search"></bal-icon>
  <bal-input name="query"></bal-input>
  <bal-button square icon="close"></bal-button>
</bal-input-group>

<!-- after -->
<ds-input name="query" disabled required="false">
  <bal-icon slot="start" name="search"></bal-icon>
  <bal-button slot="end" square icon="close"></bal-button>
</ds-input>
```

Move `invalid`, `disabled` and `readonly` from the group to the `ds-input`, in every form (`disabled`, `disabled="true"`, `[disabled]="x"`, `disabled={x}`). When the `bal-input` already sets the same prop with the same value or binding, keep one copy. Legacy `bal-input-group` only styled its children for these three props: the inner `bal-input` stayed focusable, editable and part of the form. On `ds-input` they take effect, so report each one the `bal-input` did not already set.

Move these attributes from the group to the `ds-input` as well: `class`, `id`, `style`, `data-*` and `aria-*` attributes, structural directives such as `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`, Angular template references such as `#search`, and the React `key`. Report every moved `class`, `id`, `style`, `data-*` and `aria-*`, because styles and test selectors that targeted the group now match the field.

Leave the whole group unchanged, including the controls inside it, and report it with the reason in these cases:

| group content                                                                                                                                      | reason                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Not exactly one `bal-input`: two inputs, a `bal-input-date`, a `bal-select` or another control, or no input                                        | `ds-input` holds one native input.           |
| Text such as `CHF`, or a child element that is neither an icon nor a button, such as a `span`                                                      | The consumer has to review the layout.       |
| A child that already has a `slot` attribute                                                                                                        | The new `slot` would overwrite it.           |
| A JSX expression, an Angular control-flow block or an `ng-container` that wraps anything other than one icon or button                             | The `slot` has no single element to go on.   |
| `invalid`, `disabled` or `readonly` on both the group and the `bal-input`, with different values or bindings                                       | The merged value would change the behaviour. |
| An attribute that both the group and the `bal-input` set, such as `class` on both, or a group attribute not listed above, such as an event binding | Moving it would merge or lose it.            |

### Tags and imports

- **HTML**: `<bal-input>` becomes `<ds-input>` and `<bal-input-date>` becomes `<ds-datepicker>`, including the closing tags.
- **Angular**: the same tag renames in `.html` templates and in inline `template:` strings, including the closing tags. When a file imports `BalInput` or `BalInputDate` from `@baloise/ds-angular`, move only those symbols to `import { DsInput, DsDatepicker } from '@helvetia-design/angular'` (only the ones the file used) and leave the other symbols on the `@baloise` import. Rename them in `imports: [...]` as well. `DsInput` and `DsDatepicker` bring their own `ControlValueAccessor`, so `ngModel` and reactive forms keep working. Neither tag has its own bundle. Only multi-family bundles such as `BalFormBundle` or `BalComponentBundle` hold them. They stay, and `DsInput` and `DsDatepicker` are added next to them, as `SKILL.md` "Legacy types and bundles" describes.
- **React**: `<BalInput>` becomes `<DsInput>` and `<BalInputDate>` becomes `<DsDatepicker>`, including the closing tags. Import them from `@helvetia-design/react`. When the existing `@baloise/ds-react` import also binds other symbols, move only `BalInput` and `BalInputDate` and leave the others on the `@baloise` import. If the file already imports `DsDatepicker` from `@helvetia-design/react`, add to that import instead of creating a second one.
- **`BalInputGroup`**: it has no `Ds*` replacement in Angular or React. Remove it from the `@baloise` import and from `imports: [...]` once no `<BalInputGroup>` is left in the file, or in Angular no `bal-input-group` is left in the template (the `.html` beside the class or the inline `template:`). Drop the whole import line when no binding is left.

### Events

Both tags emit the same five events, and both new components add `dsClick`.

Rewrite only handlers that are attached to the element being migrated. `balChange`, `balInput`, `balBlur`, and `balFocus` are emitted by many other legacy components, so never rewrite a handler on another element, and never rename them by search and replace across the file.

Retype handler parameters and refs as `SKILL.md` "Legacy types and bundles" describes. On a `ds-input`, `BalEvents.BalInput*` and `BalInputCustomEvent` become `DsInputCustomEvent`. On a `ds-datepicker`, `BalEvents.BalInputDate*` and `BalInputDateCustomEvent` become `DsDatepickerCustomEvent`. Write a detail alias such as `BalEvents.BalInputChangeDetail` out as the new detail type, `string | null` for `dsChange` and `dsInput`. `HTMLBalInputElement` becomes `HTMLDsInputElement`, and `HTMLBalInputDateElement` becomes `HTMLDsDatepickerElement`. `HTMLBalInputGroupElement` and `BalProps.BalInputGroup*` have no target. Leave them in place. The scan lists the `BalEvents.*` and `Bal*CustomEvent` types. It does not list `BalProps.*` or `HTMLBal*Element`, so search for them yourself in each file with a finding.

When the value in `balChange` or `balInput` is read, note that it is `string | undefined` in legacy and `string | null` in the new components. A cleared field now yields `null`. Do not edit the handler, report it.

### Methods

`setFocus()` and `getInputElement()` keep their names, and so does `setBlur()` (it was `@internal` in legacy). `setAriaForm()` does not exist on the new components. Apply Unmapped props and handlers (`SKILL.md`).

Angular splits a component across `x.component.html` and `x.component.ts`, and the class file often calls these methods through `@ViewChild` or `viewChild` without naming the tag, so the scan cannot see it. For every `.html` finding, open the same-basename `.ts` file beside it and check it for `setAriaForm` calls and for `balChange`, `balInput`, and `INVALID_VALUE`. React and plain HTML callers hold the element in a ref or a query result, so look for calls on that variable in the same file.

## 4. Report

Write the report as `shared/report.md` describes, with the per-file summary under Files changed. Every item below gets its own line in the coverage checklist, found or none found.

Needs your attention when found:

1. Every dropped `allowInvalidValue`.
2. Every event handler that needs manual rework.
3. Every `setAriaForm()` call, with its Unmapped props and handlers outcome.
4. Every unsupported `textAlign`, with its Unmapped props and handlers outcome.
5. Every unsupported `clickable`, with its Unmapped props and handlers outcome. The new `dsClick` event reports the click, so the consumer can replace the pattern.
6. Every unsupported `hasIconRight`, with its Unmapped props and handlers outcome.
7. Every legacy type left or written out, as `SKILL.md` "Legacy types and bundles" describes: each `BalProps.BalInput*` type and each `HTMLBalInputGroupElement` left in place, each detail alias such as `BalEvents.BalInputChangeDetail` written out, and each multi-family bundle such as `BalFormBundle` or `BalComponentBundle` kept with `Ds*` symbols added next to it.
8. Every handler or form binding that reads the value. A cleared field now yields `null` where legacy yielded `undefined`, so code that checks `=== undefined` needs review.
9. Every place that compares against the string `INVALID_VALUE`. Search the consumer code for it.
10. Every file where `allowInvalidValue` was dropped, reviewed for logic that relies on `INVALID_VALUE`.
11. Every `bal-input-date` rewritten to `ds-datepicker`. `bal-input-date` was a plain text field with a date mask, and `ds-datepicker` adds a calendar popup opened from a button. Do not add attributes to compensate.
12. One-time note: `ds-input` and `ds-datepicker` have `label`, `description`, and `color`. Fields may need a `label` now. Do not add one yourself.
13. Every selector that targets the legacy elements and that the scan cannot see, such as classes starting with `bal-input`, the `bal-input-date` internals, and selectors on `bal-input-group`. Tests and styles that query them break. Do not rewrite those selectors yourself. Report them.
14. Every `bal-input-group` left unchanged, with the reason from the table.
15. Every attribute moved from a `bal-input-group` to the `ds-input`: each `invalid`, `disabled` or `readonly` the `bal-input` did not set, because it now disables, locks or marks the field instead of only styling it, and each `class`, `id`, `style`, `data-*` or `aria-*`, because styles and test selectors now match the field.

Coverage only, written to the file:

16. Every `required` that was set to false.
17. Every event handler that was renamed.
18. Every `bal-input-group` that was unwrapped into the `start` and `end` slots.

Leave every change unstaged for the consumer to review, including `ds-migration-report.md`. Stop. Do not run `git add` or `git commit`.

Done when every numbered item has its line in `ds-migration-report.md`, the chat shows only the attention items and the pointer line, and the working tree is still unstaged.
